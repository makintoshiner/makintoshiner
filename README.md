## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Timur, and I'm a motivated Junior Data Analyst with a passion for data analysis and developing innovative business solutions. I have strong skills in SQL, Excel, and Power BI, along with a solid foundation in statistics, A/B testing, and product metrics. I actively work on pet projects, including the creation of interactive dashboards. I'm a quick learner, a strong team player, and always open to new challenges.
